So far just a prototype project.

Things finished:
  - A* pathfinding for unit movement
  - Simple AI for enemy units
  - BattleSytem (well people can kill each other through the convential menuing) 
  - Ability System, so far you can push and switch positions with other units

TODO:
  Gameplay ideas! I don't want to just rip stuff =/
